Walking Tour App (Flutter)

This is a minimal scaffold for the Walking Tour Flutter app.

Next steps:
1. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. From this folder run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

To create a full Flutter project from here you can either run `flutter create .` in this folder after installing Flutter, or run `flutter create walking_tour_app` in a parent folder.

GitHub remote: I detected `gh` (GitHub CLI) is not installed. I can create a remote repo if you install and authenticate `gh`, or you can provide a remote URL and I will add/push it.
